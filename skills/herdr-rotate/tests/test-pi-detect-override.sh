# call (fired when the settings picker never rendered during the initial wait, but turns out to
# still be open -- and stuck -- once that recovery close checks it). Not reachable as a
# meaningful end-to-end regression test via the full handoff/finish/verify machinery: set -e's
# own default behavior already aborts the handoff path regardless of this branch's own explicit
# propagation, and pi's verify() model/effort mismatch check already independently catches a
# never-rendered picker during the finish path -- both mask a broken `|| return 1` here. This
# calls detect_override directly instead, so its own return code is what's actually asserted.
